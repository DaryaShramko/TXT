My name is Darya Shramko, I am 25 yers old. I have been begining to study on Vadim's Kzendzov course since January 2022. I always develope myself and I like do it, that's why I enjoy on course every lesson. I want to tell a bit about myself. I love the animals, so I have a few at home. I have a dog which call Roki, the two rats and fish that called Eduard. I dream of a remotely job. Afrer course will finish, I wish I earned 500 dollars for the start.
