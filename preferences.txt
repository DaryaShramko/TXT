I absolutely love every season of the year, so I glad that live in Belarus. I feel sorry for people who live in Dubai ) I  like all kind of music.  I listen to pop-music, deep-house, electronic, rock, death-core, hard-core, rap-core.  
Usually I watch all kind of movie, but I can't stand horror movie. Once I went into cinema there horror movie was shown. In the beginning of movie suddenly something disgusting appeared on screen. I started to cry and got away to home. Despite my preferences of movie, sometime I like reading horror book. 
I dream of visit Czech, Spain, Georgia. I think, if I will have a journey to Georgia I will gain weight, due to there a lot of tasty food. I lose my self-control when I see something delicious.
